    - When requested, the _VehicleCore_ shall transition the UAV between states according to allowed state transitions as depicted in the UAV state transition diagram.
    - If a client registers for notifications, the _UIMiddleware_ shall send notifications for specific events.
    - The _VehicleCore_ shall assign a unique ID to each activated UAV.
    - The _SingleUAVFlightPlanScheduler_ shall only execute one flight plan at a time for each UAV.
    - The _UAVActivationManager_ shall ensure that only one instance of each registered drone is active at any time.
    - The _VehicleCore_ shall associate a UAV_TYPE for each UAV defining UAV's basic attributes.
    - Each waypoint shall be specified using coordinates that include longitude latitude and altitude.
    - When a flight plan is executed, the _VehicleCore_ shall send the next waypoint to the UAV.
    - The _SingleUAVFlightPlanScheduler_ shall maintain a managed list of pending flight plans for Each UAV.
    - If requested, the _SingleUAVFlightPlanScheduler_ shall unassign the flight plan assigned to a UAV that is awaiting execution.
    - If a UAV has pending flight plans, then when the UAV reaches the final waypoint of UAV's current flight plan, the _SingleUAVFlightPlanScheduler_ shall execute the next assigned flight plan.
    - When a UAV's current flight is cancelled, the _SingleUAVFlightPlanScheduler_ shall in turn cancel all scheduled flight plans for that UAV.
    - The _UIMiddleware_ shall provide an interface for registering UI clients.
    - The _UIMiddleware_ shall assign one control-client at a time for each UAV.
    - If a command is issued by the _VaadinUI_ for an UAV, the _VaadinUI_ shall request control of that UAV.
    - When the _RealTimeFlightUI_ is loaded, a map shall be displayed.
    - The _RealTimeFlightUI_ shall display the location of active UAVs as icons on the map.
    - When a stationary or moving object is within the proximity of a UAV, the _ObjectAvoidance_ system shall issue evasive directives to the UAV.
    - If a UAV takes evasive actions, the system shall ensure that the UAV will eventually reach UAV's destination.
    - The _ObjectAvoidance_ system shall only issue commands within the capabilities of the UAV.
    - When a UAV has an active onboard Obstacle Avoidance, then the _ObstacleAvoidance_ system shall not issue directives.
    - When a _GCS_ requests activation of a newly detected UAV, the _GCSMiddleware_ shall forward the request to Dronology.
    - The _UAVActivationManager_ shall only activate UAVs that are registered.
    - When the _GCS_ loses the connection to an UAV, the _GCS_ shall attempt to reconnect.
    - When the "return to home" command is issued, the _FlightManager_ shall return the UAV to UAV's original launch location without issuing any additional waypoint or routing commands.
    - The _FlightRouteManager_ shall define flight routes as an ordered sequence of waypoints in which the first waypoint represents the first target location and the final waypoint represents the final target location.
    - The _FlightRouteManager_ shall ensure that all flight routes represent a VALID_FLIGHT_ROUTE.
    - The _FlightRouteManager_ shall persist flight routes.
    - When a flight route requires a customized takeoff altitude that differs from the system's default takeoff altitude, the altitude shall be specified in the flight route.
    - When requested, the _CoordinateSystem_ shall transform coordinates to alternate formats.
